Standard shell configuration. It enables some options in bash and exports some environment variables.

##.bash_alias

Sourced by `.bash_profile`, contains useful aliases.

##.git_commit_template

A file containing a standard template for git commits that I (try to but generally don't) use.

##.gitconfig

A list of files for git to ignore for all repos on the machine.
